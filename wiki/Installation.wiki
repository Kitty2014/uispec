#summary How To Install UISpec.

===Getting UISpec===
Currently UISpec is available only through the repository.  Soon we will have a distribution zip that you can download. For now just:

 * Checkout/export UISpec using subversion, which is explained [http://code.google.com/p/uispec/source/checkout here].


Inside you will find

 * The API documentation: doc/html/index.html
 * The source code: src/
 * The static library for use with iphone XCode projects: bin/UISpec/UISpec_X_Y.a
 * The header files for use with the static library in your iphone XCode projects: bin/UISpec/Headers
 * The XCode projects for building UISpec and running the demo: xcode/UISpec and xcode/UISpecDemo

===Adding UISpec To Your Project===
To add the UISpec static library and headers to your XCode project:

 * From the Groups & Files pane, right click on the Frameworks (if it exists) folder or the Link Binary With Libraries folder and select
   * Add -> Existing Files...

 * Browse and Add
   * "{YOUR PATH TO UISPEC}/bin/UISpec/UISpec_X_Y.a"
    
For each target you added it too, you should see the static library (.a) listed in the Link Binary With Libraries folder

To add the headers:

 * From the Groups & Files pane, double click the respective target or right click and select, Get Info, and then click on the Build tab.
 * Under the setting, Header Search Paths, "{YOUR PATH TO UISPEC}/bin/UISpec/Headers"


Note: The static library has been compiled for the both the simulator and the device.
